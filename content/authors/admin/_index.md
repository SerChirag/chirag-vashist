Hello There! I am a Software Engineer working in Microsoft working in the domain of Digital Security and Risk.

I received my B.Tech. Honors degree in Computer Science with Minor in Management from Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi. My research interest is Computer Vision with application in biometric recognition and security. As part of my final-year thesis, I worked on optimizing the indexing of biometric data and generation of cancellable biometric templates.

I have also volunteered as an administrator and mentor at Australian Open-Source Software Innovation and Education (AOSSIE). As a Google-Summer-of-Code student for AOSSIE, I worked on Mind The Word, a language immersion browser extension.
